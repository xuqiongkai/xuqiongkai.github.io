    "content": "I am a research fellow on Security in NLP at the University of Melbourne (UoM). I have finished my Ph.D. programme at the Australian National University (ANU). Before that, I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). I have worked several years for industry labs, Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab, Data61 CSIRO, IBM China Research Lab, and Microsoft Research Asia (intern). My research generally lies in among Privacy &amp; Security, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Recently, I am interested in auditing machine learning models, e.g., 1) privacy and security issues in ML/NLP models and 2) new evaluation paradigms for ML/NLP models.\n\nMisc.\n\nI boulder regularly and aim at climbing high someday. I believe that doing research is similar to bouldering and climbing.\n\nIf you are intrested in working with me, on some common research goals, please feel free to contact me.\nEmail: qiongkai.xu[at]unimelb.edu.au\n",
