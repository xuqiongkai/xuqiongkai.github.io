I am a research fellow on Security in NLP at the University of Melbourne (UoM), with a Ph.D. from the Australian National University (ANU) and degrees from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). I have gained working experience at industry labs including Huawei Noah's Ark Lab, Data61 CSIRO, IBM China Research Lab, and Microsoft Research Asia (intern). My research focus spans across Privacy & Security, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, with a current interest in ***auditing machine learning models***. Specifically, I am exploring novel evaluation paradigms and addressing privacy and security issues associated with ML/NLP models.

As an avid boulderer, I strive to reach new grades and heights every day. I see research as a similar journey, one that requires patience, persistence, and a constant pursuit of improvement.
