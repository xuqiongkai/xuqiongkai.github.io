I serve as a lecturer (assistant professor) at Macquarie University, having earned my PhD at the Australian National University. Before my current role, I worked as a research fellow on Security in NLP at the University of Melbourne. My professional journey includes valuable experience at industry research labs, such as Huawei Noah's Ark Lab, Data61 CSIRO, IBM China Research Lab, and an internship at Microsoft Research Asia. My research focus spans across Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Privacy & Security and Data Mining, with a current interest in ***auditing machine learning models***. I am dedicated to exploring innovative evaluation paradigms and addressing privacy and security challenges associated with ML/NLP models.

## Miscellaneous


As an avid boulderer, I strive to reach new grades and heights every day. I see research as a similar journey, one that requires patience, persistence, and a constant pursuit of improvement. If you share my passion for exploration and discovery and want to collaborate on research projects, don't hesitate to get in touch.
