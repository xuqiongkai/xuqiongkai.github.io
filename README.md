# Qiongkai Xu
I joined Huawei Noah's Ark Lab as a research scientist. I have recently finished my Ph.D. programme at the Australian National University (ANU). Before that, I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). I have worked several years for industry labs, Data61 CSIRO, IBM-CRL, and MSRA (intern). My research interest includes Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Data Mining. I am currently interested in ***certifying and developing 'superhuman' machine learning models***. To be more specific, I am developing *i)* new evaluation paradigms for certifying ML models and *ii)* new training paradigms for better ML models.

If you are intrested in working with me, on some common research goals, please feel free to contact me.

## Misc

I boulder regularly, and aim at climbing high someday. Doing research is somewhat similar to climbing.
