<!-- I joined Huawei Noah's Ark Lab as a research scientist. I have recently finished my Ph.D. programme at the Australian National University (ANU). Before that, I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). I have worked several years for industry labs, Data61 CSIRO, IBM-CRL, and MSRA (intern). My research interest includes Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Data Mining. I am currently interested in ***certifying and developing 'superhuman' machine learning models***. To be more specific, I am developing *i)* new evaluation paradigms for certifying ML models and *ii)* new training paradigms for better ML models. -->

I am a research fellow on Security in NLP at the University of Melbourne (UoM). I have finished my Ph.D. programme at the Australian National University (ANU). Before that, I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). I have worked several years for industry labs, Huawei Noah's Ark Lab, Data61 CSIRO, IBM China Research Lab, and Microsoft Research Asia (intern). My research generally lies in among Privacy & Security, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Recently, I am interested in ***auditing machine learning models***, e.g., 1) privacy and security issues in ML/NLP models and 2) new evaluation paradigms for ML/NLP models.

If you are intrested in working with me, on some common research goals, please feel free to contact me.

## Misc

I boulder regularly and aim at climbing high someday. I believe that doing research is similar to bouldering and climbing.
