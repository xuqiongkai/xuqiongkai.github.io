# Qiongkai Xu
I am a research scientist at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab. I have finished my Ph.D. programme at the Auatralian National University (ANU). I have worked several years for industry labs, Data61 CSIRO, IBM-CRL, and MSRA (intern). My research interest includes Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Data Mining. I am currently interested in *certifying and developing 'superhuman' machine learning models*.

## Misc

I boulder regularly, and aim at climbing high someday. Doing research is somewhat similar to climbing.
