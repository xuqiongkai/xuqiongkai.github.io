  # Qiongkai Xu
  ### Lecturer (equiv. Asst. Prof.) @ Macquarie University
  ### Honorary Fellow @ University of Melbourne
---

Dr. Qiongkai Xu is a lecturer at Macquarie University, having earned his PhD from the Australian National University and previously served as a research fellow at the University of Melbourne. His research primarily focuses on Natural Language Processing, Privacy & Security, Machine Learning and Data Mining. Recently, his attention has been directed towards ***auditing machine learning models***, specifically in two areas: 1) identifying and addressing privacy and security issues in ML/NLP models and their applications and 2) developing comprehensive evaluation theory and methods for ML/NLP models from various perspectives. 


If you're passionate about these research topics, I would love to hear your thoughts and ideas.
